Interview Kickstart Website Clone

This folder contains a clone of the Interview Kickstart website, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My project aimed to replicate the main functionalities and design of the original website.

Challenges Encountered

Countdown Timer Implementation
One of the main challenges I faced was implementing the countdown timer for the website. The timer needed to accurately display the time remaining every second.

Time Constraints
Another challenge was the limited time available to complete this project.Based on the difficulty of the project, I managed to prioritize tasks even if i didn't complete all

Getting Images and Icons
Getting assets such as images, icons, css properies such width, height etc posed an additional challenge. While I was able to get approximately 80% of the required assets, sourcing the remaining assets was difficult and time consuming.

Project Status

Although the project could not be completed perfectly due to time and resource constraints, the implemented clone provides a functional representation of the Interview Kickstart website.

Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Service Now Innovato Team for giving me the opportunity to show my skills, also resources such as online tutorials, documentation, and community forums were instrumental in overcoming challenges and completing the project.
